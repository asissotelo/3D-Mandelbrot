# 3D-Mandelbrot
Project for Physics 129L

The goal of this project was to create python based program to create a 3D Mandelbrot object and render a single stationary image utilizing a raytracing algorithm. I broke the development into three separate functions.
1. Creates the Mandelbrot object using Quaternion mathematics.
2. The raytracing algorithm of an object in 3D space with some implemantation for advanced graphics
3. The user experience

The following articles where utilized to develop the program:
